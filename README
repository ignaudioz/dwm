dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Patches
--------------

- [Clickable statusbar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/) with my build of [dwmblocks](https://github.com/ignaudioz/dwmblocks).
- [xrdb](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/xrdb/) colors/variables (i.e. works with `pywal`, etc.).
- [stacker](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/stacker/): Move windows up the stack manually (<kbd>super-K/J</kbd>).
- [swallow patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swallow/): if a program run from a terminal would make it inoperable, it temporarily takes its place to save space.
- [systray patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/systray/): A simple system tray implementation. Multi-monitor is also supported. The tray follows the selected monitor.
- [attachaside](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachaside/): Make new clients get attached and focused in the stacking area instead of always becoming the new master.
- [fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/): Adds gaps and control them in real time (<kbd>Lalt-'-'/"+").

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):
    git clone https://github.com/ignaudioz/dwm.git
    cd dwm
